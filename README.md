# Learn Debezium
Working sample project to help learn debezium and how it works.  I've include 2 sql server services because it was a practical example for my teams, but others can be added/used like mysql or postgres seen in common demo packages.


## Docker Instructions

Start everything (recommended)

``` docker compose up -d ```

Start select services (example)

``` docker compose up -d kafka akhq ```
